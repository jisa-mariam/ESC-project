This is the Github Repository for project 2 (Capstone Allocation)

Approach taken towards the project is two-pronged: An online form parser, and a script for Adobe Illustrator

How it works (Online form parser):

-Usage of google forms to collect preferences submissions from student groups  
-Google forms can be configured to check for invalid inputs  
-Usage of online excel speadsheet for capstone team to view the submissions realtime and edit where necessary  
-Usage of a python file to further check the excel spreadsheet for total submissions count and possible duplicate  
-Where necessary, the code will inform the capstone team of any issues.  
-Files are all in PreferencesSubmission  
-Google form is www.tinyurl.com/capstonepref  


How it works (script for Illustrator):


- Run script from Adobe Illustrator with a chosen csv file
- Script will attempt to allocate projects based on dimensions of projects in csv file
- User will be informed of projects that are not given an allocation
